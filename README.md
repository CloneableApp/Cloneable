```

## Information

Cloneable is a free and open source desktop application that can clone websites to your local computer automatically, with smart handling of links, images, files, stylesheets, and more, so sites load seamlessly for offline browsing.

It is built with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org). Check the [package.json](./package.json) for a list of all dependencies.

Behind the scenes, Cloneable relies heavily on [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/).

## TODO

- Add dark mode
- Add internationalization
- Add pagination to Clones page
- Add different format options to supply cookies (instead of just Netscape cookies.txt format)
- Add ability to stop and continue Clones, saving progress
